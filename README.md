✈️ Southwest Airlines Flight Delay Analysis
📌 Project Title
Southwest Airlines Flight Delay Analysis (Interactive Dashboard + Insights)

📄 Project Description
This project aims to analyze flight delay patterns for Southwest Airlines using real-world data. The focus is on understanding the reasons behind delays, identifying the most affected airports, and visualizing key metrics to derive actionable insights. An interactive dashboard was created to explore delays by categories such as weather, security, carrier issues, and more.

🧰 Tools Used
Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning & preprocessing

Power BI – Interactive dashboard creation and visualization

PostgreSQL - Queries to get the required data for Analysis 

📊 Data Overview
The dataset contains detailed information about flight arrival delays, cancellation events, and various types of delay reasons for Southwest Airlines across multiple U.S. airports. Key columns include:

Airport Code

Flights Delay > 15 Min

Cancelled Arrivals

Diverted Arrivals

Delay categories:

NAS (National Aviation System)

Carrier

Security

Weather

Late Aircraft

The dataset represents flight delay data aggregated across airports, months, and years.

📈 Key Findings
Total Delays:

Total NAS Delays: 23.2K

Total Weather Delays: 1.41K

Security Delay Events: 388.90

Total Flight Arrival Delays: 6M (Cumulative)

Delay Reason Distribution:

Late Aircraft Delays are the most frequent (≈46.45% of total delays).

Carrier Delays make up ≈30.4%.

NAS Delays are ≈21.49%.

Security and Weather Delays are relatively rare (less than 2% combined).

Airport-Specific Observations:

DEN (Denver), LAS (Las Vegas), BWI (Baltimore) are among the top 3 in total arriving flights.

MCO (Orlando) has the highest number of flights delayed over 15 minutes (2392).

SFO (San Francisco) has a very low number of delays and only 1 cancelled arrival.

STL (St. Louis) has the highest number of cancelled arrivals (300).

TPA (Tampa) has the highest diverted arrivals (27).

MCO and LAX lead in carrier-related delays.

TPA and ATL show noticeable weather delay patterns.

📊 Visual Insights (From Dashboard)
A pie chart shows delay breakdowns, highlighting that Late Aircraft Delays dominate delay reasons, followed by Carrier and NAS delays.

A bar chart visualizes the total arriving flights by airport, clearly indicating DEN and LAS as major hubs.

Interactive slicers (Airport, Year, Month) allow dynamic filtering of data for focused analysis.

The data table shows delays >15 min, cancellations, and diverted arrivals by airport, helping quickly identify outlier airports in terms of operational inefficiencies.

🧾 Conclusion
This analysis reveals that the majority of delays are due to Late Aircraft and Carrier issues, emphasizing internal operational challenges over external ones like weather or security. Airports such as MCO, STL, and TPA are particularly impacted and may benefit from targeted efficiency improvements. The interactive Power BI dashboard enables ongoing exploration of patterns across time and airport locations, making it a valuable monitoring tool for airline operations and performance tracking.
